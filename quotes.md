Be here right now with me

It has to be one unified thing

Am I willing to put in the effort? What is worth putting in the effort? LIFE

External Consciousness

All you can control in life is how you react to it


The greatest danger for most of us 
is not that we aim too high and we miss
rather our aim is too low and we make it.
- Michelangelo

Our struggles determine our successes

Joy is in the climb itself

Entitlement is a failed strategy

Self awareness onion

Don’t overvalue material success

What are the values you prioritize the most

Choose better things to care about

Take responsibility to all situations you are in regardless of how you got there

The more something threatens your identity, the more you will avoid doing it.

Failure is the way forward

If you’re going to do something, do it to the best of your ability— or don’t waste your time.
-Tom Coughlin

I think it's much more interesting to live not knowing than to have answers which might be wrong. I have
approximate answers and possible beliefs and different degrees of uncertainty about different things,
but I am not absolutely sure of anything and there are many things I don't know anything about, such as
whether it means anything to ask why we're here. I don't have to know an answer. I don't feel frightened
not knowing things, by being lost in a mysterious universe without any purpose, which is the way it
really is as far as I can tell.
-Richard Feynman

I want to perpetuate my consciousness onto disk , anything less is eventual death. -Paul Weiss

There is what everybody thinks of you
There is what people you care about think of you
There is what you think people you care about think of you
Then there is what you think about you
Shown to none
Deceived and beaten
Truth to none
But you
-Paul Weiss

The true artistic impulse has nothing to do with pleasing the audience— or, for that matter, with
pleasing the impresario so you’ll get more jobs or more money. That’s not art. If you are an artist, you
want to create a giant wall around yourself and, inside that wall, to follow your honesty and your
intuition. What the audience will see is a man or woman who is prisoner of his or her passion, and that
is the most inspiring performance in the world.
-Philippe Petit

Making a program more generic renders it simultaneously both simpler and more powerful.
-Paul Weiss

Nothing is given to man on earth. Everything he needs has to be produced. And here man faces his basic
alternative: he can survive in only one of two ways—by the independent work of his own mind or as a
parasite fed by the minds of others. The creator originates. The parasite borrows. The creator faces
nature alone. The parasite faces nature through an intermediary. “The creator’s concern is the conquest
of nature. The parasite’s concern is the conquest of men. “The creator lives for his work. He needs no
other men. His primary goal is within himself. The parasite lives second-hand. He needs others. Others
become his prime motive. “The basic need of the creator is independence. The reasoning mind cannot work
under any form of compulsion. It cannot be curbed, sacrificed or subordinated to any consideration
whatsoever. It demands total independence in function and in motive. To a creator, all relations with
men are secondary.
-Ayn Rand

Combination is just a complicated word for simplification.
-Paul Weiss

Caminante, no hay camino, se hace camino al andar...
(translation: Traveler, there is no path. A path is made by walking.)
-Unknown

The thing about life is most people don't really care about your own except as it pertains to how you
impact their's.
-Paul Weiss

Play attention

Don't live with broken windows

Bubbles arise if the price far exceeds the asset's fundamental value, to the point that no plausible
future income scenario can justify the price.
- Justin Fox

Don't Be a secondhander

It's not the mountain we conquer, but ourselves

50% of what we know is wrong. The problem is that we do not know which 50% it is.

Out of clutter, find simplicity. From discord, find harmony. In the middle of difficulty lies
opportunity.
—Albert Einstein

I did absolutely nothing, and it was everything that I thought it could be.
—Peter Gibbons, Office Space

One general law, leading to the advancement of all organic beings, namely, multiply, vary, let the
strongest live and the weakest die.
―Charles Darwin

As many more individuals of each species are born than can possibly survive; and as, consequently, there
is a frequently recurring struggle for existence, it follows that any being, if it vary however slightly
in any manner profitable to itself, under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life, will
have a better chance of surviving, and thus be naturally selected. From the strong principle of
inheritance, any selected variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form.
―Charles Darwin

Do, or do not. There is no try.
–Yoda

Motion is created by the destruction of balance.
—Leonardo da Vinci

In a time of deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
-George Orwell

Was it love or was it the idea of being in love?
-Pink Floyd

Maybe not today maybe not tomorrow but for the rest of your life
-Pink Floyd

Is this the way that it's always been? Could it ever have been different?
-Pink Floyd

I've always been mad, I know I've been mad, like the most of us...very hard to explain why you're mad,
even if you're not mad...
-Pink Floyd

I am not what I ought to be, Not what I want to be, Not what I am going to be, But I am thankful that I
am better than I used to be.
-John wooden

Never believe you’re better than anybody else, but remember that you’re just as good as everybody else.
-John wooden

Things may come to those who wait, but only the things left by those who hustle.
-Lincoln

Life is way too fuckin short, especially when you are dead.

What the government is good at is collecting taxes, taking away your freedoms and killing people. It’s
not good at much else.
—Tom Clancy

If you take away all my agonies I would merely be a shell of who I am today

Show me good art and I see discipline show me great art and I feel the artists pain

Greatness is born from pain and struggle not from comfort and happiness

If I shield my kids from all pain they will grow up to be spoiled parasites

Facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored.
-Aldous Huxley.

Within your mind lies a hidden treasure only you can unlock.

Your true home hold treasures below your memories.

Try not to become a man of success but rather try to become a man of value.
-Einstein

Try your hardest in all ways and you are a success. Period. Do less than that and you have failed to one
degree or another.
-John Wooden

You never fail if you know in your heart that you did the best of which you are capable. I did my best.
That is all I could do. Are you going to make mistakes? Of course. But it is not failure if you make the
full effort.
-John Wooden

Do not become too concerned about what others may think of you. Be very concerned about what you think
of yourself. Too often, we care more about a stranger’s opinion of us than our own.
-John Wooden

People usually know what they should do to get what they want. They just won’t do it. They won’t pay the
price. Understand there is a price to be paid for achieving anything of significance. You must be
willing to pay the price.
-John Wooden

Each one of us has, somewhere in his heart, the dream to make a living world, a universe.
-Christopher Alexander

In a world which is healthy, whole, alive, and self-maintaining, people themselves can be alive and
self-creating. In a world which is unwhole and self-destroying, people cannot be alive: they will
inevitably themselves be self-destroying, and miserable.
-Christopher Alexander

Self-replicating is a quality something that is alive must have.

Sometimes the thing that has no name is the most desired

Destiny has two ways of crushing us, by refusing our wishes and by fulfilling them.
-Henri Amiel

If you are not experiencing and learning new things you are degrading, decaying, dying.

Complexity is a symptom of confusion, not a cause.
-Jeff Hawkins

the formation and strengthening of synapses is what causes memories to be stored.
-Jeff Hawkins

The brain may have thirty trillion connections

You know I always wanted to pretend I was an architect.
-George Costanza

It's not about the past or what has happened to you only how it has shaped your ability to predict and
navigate the future.

So if you now number yourself among the disenchanted, then you have no choice but to accept things as
they are, or to seriously seek something else. But beware of looking for goals: look for a way of life.
Decide how you want to live and then see what you can do to make a living WITHIN that way of life.
-Hunter Thompson

So we shall let the reader answer this question for himself: Who is the happier man, he who has braved
the storm of life and lived, or he who has stayed securely on shore and merely existed?
-Hunter thompson

Some people will tell you that slow is good – but I’m here to tell you that fast is better. I’ve always
believed this, in spite of the trouble it’s caused me. Being shot out of a cannon will always be better
than being squeezed out of a tube.
-Hunter Thompson

A man who procrastinates in his choosing will inevitably have his choice made for him by circumstance.
-Hunter Thompson

Ask for no guarantees, ask for no security, there never was such an animal.
And if there were, it would be related to the great sloth which hangs upside down in a tree all day
every day, sleeping it's life away.
To hell with that," he said, "shake the tree and knock the great sloth down on his ass.
― Ray Bradbury, Fahrenheit 451

Below are quotes from Bloomberg by Bloomberg:

If a company can't survive a change at the top, the top person hasn't done her or his job.

Work hard, value education, and do things yourself, whether the labor was mental or physical...it's the "doers," the lean and hungry ones, those with ambition in their eyes and fire in their bellies and no notions of social caste, who go the furthest and achieve the most.

Never let the customer go down the street to another store - he might find they sell the same thing there and not come back...Do the trade today, figure out how to make it profitable tomorrow.

Great financial success comes from starting businesses with concrete products in the real world, bulding jobs, creating value, and helping people.

It's said that 80 percent of life is just showing up.  I believe that, You can never have complete mastery over your existence.  You can't choose the advantages you start out with, and you certainly can't pick your genetic intelligence level.  But you can control how hard you work.  I'm sure someone, someplace, is smart enough to succeed while "keeping it in perspective" and not working too hard, but I've never met him or her.  The more you work, the better you do.  It's that simple.  I always outworked the other person (and if I hadn't, he or she would be writing this book).

Life, I've found, works the follwing way: Daily, your're presented with many small and surprising opportunities.  Sometimes you seize one that takes you to the top.  Most, though, if valuable at all, take you only a little way.  To succeed, you must string together many small incremental advances - rather than count on higgint the lottery jackpot once.  Trusting to great luck is a strategy not likely to work for most people.  As a practical matter, constantly enhance your skills, put in as many hours as possible, and make tactical plans for the next few steps.  Then, based on what actually occurs, look one more move ahead and adjust the plan.  Take lots of chances, and make lots of individual, spur of the moment decisions.

You can only accomplish what's possible when you get there.  Then, whatever your idea is, you've got to do more of it than anyone else - a task that's easier if you structure things so that you like doing them.

Happiness for me has always been the thrill of the unknown, trying something that everyone says can't be done, feeling that gnawing pit in my stomach that says "Danger ahead."

If you're going to succeed, you need a vision, one that's affordable, practical, and fills a customer need.  Then, go for it.  Don't worry too much about the details.  Don't second-guess your creativity.  Avoid overanalyzing the new project's potential.  Most importantly, don't strategize abou tthe long term too much.

Outsiders at best do only what's asked.  Insiders do what's needed.

No big company thinks a little start-up company will ever become a major competitor.  Invariably, by tthe time the big guy catches on, it's too late.

If you're not providing something unique, you have no ability to impose charges.

Limited supply and great demand equal high prices.

Making change is difficult.

90 percent of the costs go into building the last 10 percent of the functionality

You can do a six month software project in twelve months.  You can probably do a twelve month project in two years.  You cannot do a two year project ever.  Humans need to see results in time frames they can handle.

MVP: Minimal Viable Product

As a bachelor who traveled with a big expense account, I had a girlfriend in every city, skied in every resort, ate in every four-star restaurant, and never missed a Broadway play.
