Notes from the book [Mindset by Carol Dweck](https://www.amazon.com/Mindset-Psychology-Carol-S-Dweck/dp/0345472322)

* Not only do genes and environment cooperate as we develop, but genes require input from the environment to work properly.
* There were two meanings to ability, not one: a fixed ability that needs to be proven, and a changeable ability that can be developed through learning.
* When you enter a mindset, you enter a new world.  In one world - the world of fixed traits - success is about proving you're smart or talented.  Validating yourself.
* In the other - the world of changing qualities - it's about stretching yourself to learn something new.  Developing yourself.
* Is success about learning or proving you are smart?
* If you had to choose, which would it be?  Loads of success and validation or lots of challenge?
* People with the fixed mindset said the ideal mate could:
  * Put them on a pedestal
  * Make them feel perfect
  * Worship them
* People with a growth mindset said the ideal mate would:
  * See their faults and help them work on them
  * Challenge them to become a better person
  * Encourage them to learn new things
* People in a growth mindset don't just seek challenge, they thrive on it.  The bigger the challenge, the more they stretch.
* An assessment at one point in time has little value for understanding someone's ability, let alone their potential to succeed in the future
* You have to work hardest for the things you love the most
* The growth mindset allows people to value what they are doing regardless of the outcome
* The growth mindset is the belief that abilities can be cultivated.
* What did I or can I learn from that experience?  How can I use it as a basis for growth?
* Remember test scores and measures of achievement tell you where a student is, but they don't tell you where a student could end up.
* Just because some people can do something with little or no training, it doesn't mean that other's can't do it(and sometimes do it even better) with training.
* What's so alarming is that we took ordinary children and made them into liars, simply by telling them they were smart.
* It is well known that Michael Jordan was cut from the high school varsity team
* Character - the ability to dig down and find the strength even when things are going against you
* People who worked hard, who learned how to keep their focus under pressure, and who stretched beyond their ordinary abilities when they had to.
* Those with a growth mindset found success in doing their best, in learning and improving.  And this is exactly what we find in the champions
* Those with the growth mindset found setbacks motivating.  They're informative.  They're a wake-up call.
* People with the growth mindset took charge of the processes that bring success and that maintain it.
* A company that cannot selft-correct cannot thrive
* It starts with the bosses' worry about being judged, but it winds up being everybody's fear about being judged.  It's hard for courage and innovation to survive a company wide fixed mindset
* True self-confidence is the "courage to be open - to welcome change and new ideas regardless of their source."
* Readiness to grow
* Herodotus: Whenever a group reached a decision while sober, they later reconsidered it while intoxicated (avoidance of groupthink)
* Our best bet is not simply to hire the most talented managers we can find and turn them loose, but to look for managers who also embody a growth mindset: a zest for teaching and learning, an openness to giving and receiving feedback, and an ability to confront and surmount obstacles.
* Every relationship teaches you more about who is right for you.
* Tout comprendre c'est tout pardonner (to understand all is to forgive all)
* A good lasting relationship comes from effort and from working through inevitable differences
* Fixed Mindset: if you're compatible everything should just come naturally
* Every marriage demands an effort to keep it on the right track, there is a constant tension, between the forces that hold you together and those that can tear you apart
* A no effort relationship is a doomed relationship, not a great relationship.  It takes work to communicate accurately and it takes work to expose and resolve conflicting hopes and beliefs.  It doesn't mean there is no "they lived happily ever after", but it more like "they worked happily ever after".
* The belief that partners have the potential for change should not be confused with the belief that the partner will change.  The partner has to want to change, commit to change, and take concrete actions toward change.
* Fixed Mindset: when you need validation you use people for it.
* Praising children's intelligence harms their motivation and it harms their performance
* Praise should NOT deal with the child's personality attributes, but with his efforts and achievements
* When things are too easy: "I guess that was too easy, I apologize wor wasting your time.  Let's do something you can really learn from".
* Comments on disappointment: I know how you feel, it's so disappointing to have your hopes up and to perform your best but not to win.  But you know, you haven't really earned it YET.  There were many others there who have been in it longer than you and who've worked alot harder than you.  If this is something you really want, then it's something you'll really have to work for.
* Don't judge. Teach.  It's a learning process.
* I'm always happy when I play
* A successful student is one whose primary goal is to expand their knowledge and their ways of thinking and investigating the world.  They don't see grades as an end in themselves but a means to continue to grow.
* The ideal student values knowledge for its own sake, as well as for its instrumental uses.  He or she hopes to make a contribution to society at large.
* The great teachers believe in the growth of the intellect and talent, and they are fascinated with the process of learning.
* If you don't give anything, don't expect anything.  Success is not coming to you, you must come to it.
* To love learning.  To eventually learn and think for themselves.  And to work hard on the fundamentals.
* Teaching is a wonderful way to learn.  About people and how they tick.  About what you teach.  About yourself.  About life.
* You have to apply yourself each day to becoming a little better.  By applying yourself to the task of becoming a little better each and every day over a period of time, you will become a lot better.
* Did I win or lose is the wrong question.  Did I make my best effort?
* A growth mindset is about believing people can develop their abilities.
* Setbacks are good things that should be embraced, and that setbacks should be used as a platform for learning.  They address the setback head-on and talk to their children about the next steps for learning.
* What can I learn from this?
* How can I improve?
* You're in charge of your mind.  You can help it grow by using it the right way.
* Many people with the fixed mindset think the world needs to change, not them.  They feel entitled to something better - a better job, house, or spouse.
* What did you learn today?
* What mistake did you make that taught you something?
* What did you try hard at today?
* What are the opportunities for learning and growth today? For myself? For the people around me?
* When, where, and how will I embark on my plan?
