<h2>What is OCD?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Thoughts get stuck in a loop and cannot be forgotten</li>
  <li>It is a problem and NOT a part of your child's personality</li>
  <li>Intrusive thoughts</li>
  <li>Brain hiccups</li>
  <li>Brain is stuck in danger gear and cannot move out</li>
  <li>Broken fire alarm that won't stop</li>
  <li>Junk Mail</li>
  <li>Your child don't want to behave like this</li>
  <li>Brain get's stuck in a geer</li>
  <li>OCD insists on being 100% certain beyond a shadow of a doubt which is impossible</li>
  <li>Rituals feel like tools of survival for the child</li>
  <li>Your child sacrifices immensely for OCD with little reward</li>
  <li>Compulsions can be postponed but will eventually happen like holding your breath</li>
  <li>Compulsions reduce anxiety for a short amount of time</li>
  <li>PANDAS: Some cases of Strep throat have shown a linkage because the body's immune system
    attacks a part of the brain, explains sudden onset of symptoms
  </li>
  <li>On average there will be 4 obsessions and about 5 compulsions over the entire course of the
    disease
  </li>
  <li>From a biological standpoint OCD is no different than diabetes or asthma as it is a treatable
    medical condition
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Externalize the OCD</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Is that the OCD talking?</li>
  <li>Label the OCD</li>
  <li>It's a bully who is bossing your child around</li>
  <li>Talk about it as a separate thing</li>
  <li>Join forces with your child to tell the OCD to BACK OFF!</li>
  <li>Depersonalize it</li>
  <li>Thoughts knock on your door, obsessions BARGE in</li>
</ul>

<h2>Avoid These</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Avoid reassuring your child about the obsession which is just playing to the OCD</li>

    your message and how you handle the OCD
  </li>
  <li>Don't compare siblings or relatives and always treasure your child's uniqueness</li>
  <li>Avoid letting other relatives talk about the OCD as it may embarrass your child, have private
    conversations with family before gatherings if needed
  </li>

  <li>Don't rescue your child from a scary situation when they have the most anxiety</li>
  <li>Don't reinforce the anxiety by paying too much attention to it, positive or negative</li>
</ul>

<h2>Supporting Behavior</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Tell your child they don't have to listen to the messages</li>
  <li>It's a brain trick and not real</li>
  <li>Let them know they have a choice</li>
  <li>Reassurance that they are NOT crazy and don't have to do all this stuff and they won't die if
    they don't
  </li>
  <li>Fork in the road of choosing two worlds</li>
  <li>Let your child know what he is fighting for: their time, freedom, and FUN</li>
  <li>Teach your child OCD is a brain fart not worthy of their attention</li>
  <li>Don't you own that thought</li>
  <li>It's not you, it's the OCD</li>
  <li>Don't talk to that thought, it doesn't deserve your time</li>
  <li>Just because you can imagine it does NOT mean it will happen</li>
  <li>It is junk mail don't be tricked</li>
  <li>Fork in the road, don't get pulled into a dead end, refuse to go down that road</li>
  <li>It's not true, just because you think it doesn't mean it is true</li>
  <li>What do you think is true, let's turn the volume up on that thought</li>
  <li>OCD is making you feel bad but its not real</li>
  <li>Keep going and the bad feeing will pass</li>
  <li>Change behavior first and thoughts and feelings will change later</li>
  <li>That's the OCD don't be fooled</li>
  <li>No fire here, send back the fire trucks, false alarm</li>
  <li>Don't let OCD boss you around</li>
  <li>It's a broken record saying one thing</li>
  <li>Brain is a radio playing fear all the time, change the station</li>
  <li>It just feels like you need to do it again but you really don't</li>
  <li>No trespassing obsessions, private property</li>
  <li>Knowing for sure is not as important as living</li>
  <li>You can live with maybe, you do that lots of times</li>

  <li>It's just a brain hiccup, you are smarter than this, you know better</li>
  <li>It's not your job to worry, you don't need to do extra work</li>
  <li>Exercise is a great stress reducer</li>
  <li>Be on call for whenever your child get's stuck but allow them to do the work of pushing the
    OCD away
  </li>
  <li>Is that the OCD talking? You know the answer but your brain isn't letting you hear it, we need
    to switch gears
  </li>
  <li>Are you tired, the OCD likes to take advantage of you when you are tired, lets boss it back,
    we are in charge here
  </li>
  <li>Look for partial successes, you had a few slips but you worked hard to keep it together</li>
  <li>Praise your child's efforts NOT the end result including partial success</li>
  <li>I am proud of you</li>
  <li>You are going to win this battle</li>
  <li>You handled that situation really well</li>
  <li>Wow, I'd be afraid of you if I were OCD</li>
