  <h2>What is OCD?</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Thoughts get stuck in a loop and cannot be forgotten</li>
    <li>It is a problem and NOT a part of your child's personality</li>
    <li>Intrusive thoughts</li>
    <li>Brain hiccups</li>
    <li>Junk Mail</li>
    <li>Your child don't want to behave like this</li>
  </ul>  

  <h2>Externalize the OCD</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Is that the OCD talking?</li>
    <li>Label the OCD</li>
    <li>It's a bully who is bossing your child around</li>
    <li>Talk about it as a separate thing</li>
    <li>Join forces with your child to tell the OCD to BACK OFF!</li>
    <li>Depersonalize it</li>
  </ul> 

  <h2>Avoid These</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Reassuring your child</li>
    <li>Punishment for OCD behavior</li>
    <li>Listening to the OCD demands</li>
    <li>Idea of making the OCD disappear</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Supporting Behavior</h2>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Tell your child they don't have to listen to the messages</li>
    <li>It's a brain trick and not real</li>
    <li>Let them know they have a choice</li>
    <li>Reassurance that they are NOT crazy and don't have to do all this stuff and they won't die if they don't</li>
  </ul>
