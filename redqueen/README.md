# The Red Queen by Matt Ridley Quotes

* reproduction is the sole goal for which human beings are designed; everything else is a means to that end.
* Everything can be inherited except sterility.
* because bodies do not replicate themselves but are grown, whereas genes do replicate themselves, it inevitable follows that the body is merely an evolutionary vehicle for the gene, rather than vice versa.
* 100,000 years is only 3,000 generations, a mere eye blink in evolution
* males usually compete for access to females, rather than vice versa.  There are good evolutionary reasons for this, and there are clear evolutionary consequences, too: for instance, men are more aggresive than women.
* if you spot somebody with good genes, it is your inherited habit to seek and to buy some of those genes; or, put more prosaically, people are attracted to people of high reproductive and genetic potential - the healthy, the fit, and the powerful.
* Why do human beings have two sexes? Because in mobile animals hermaphrodites are less good at doing two things at once than males and females are at each doing his or her own thing.
* Every living creature is a product of its past.
* The faster you run, the more the world moves with you and the less you make progress. Life is a chess tournament in which if you win the game, you start the next game with the handicap of a missing pawn.
* A man uses his wife to produce children for him. A woman uses her husband to make and help rear her children.
* Sex, like marriage, is a cooperative venture between two rival sets of genes.
* anything that increases reproductive success will spread at the expense of anything that does not - even if it threatens survival.
* Sex is recombination plus outcrossing: this mixing of genes is is principal feature.  The consequence is that the baby gets a thorough mixture of its four grandparents' genes (because of recombination) and its two parents' genes (because of outcrossing).
