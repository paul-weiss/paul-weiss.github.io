# The Red Queen by Matt Ridley Quotes

* reproduction is the sole goal for which human beings are designed; everything else is a means to that end.
* Everything can be inherited except sterility.
* because bodies do not replicate themselves but are grown, whereas genes do replicate themselves, it inevitable follows that the body is merely an evolutionary vehicle for the gene, rather than vice versa.
* 100,000 years is only 3,000 generations, a mere eye blink in evolution
* males usually compete for access to females, rather than vice versa.  There are good evolutionary reasons for this, and there are clear evolutionary consequences, too: for instance, men are more aggresive than women.
* if you spot somebody with good genes, it is your inherited habit to seek and to buy some of those genes; or, put more prosaically, people are attracted to people of high reproductive and genetic potential - the healthy, the fit, and the powerful.
