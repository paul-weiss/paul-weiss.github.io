        'The greatest danger for most of us in not that we aim too high and we miss, rather our aim is too low and we make it. -Michelangelo',

        'The true artistic impulse has nothing to do with pleasing the audience-or, for that matter, with pleasing the impresario so you\'ll get more jobs or more money.That\'s not art. If you are an artist, you want to create a giant wall around yourself and, inside that wall, to follow your honesty and your intuition.  That the audience will see is a man or woman who is prisoner of his or her passion, and that is the most inspiring performance in the world. ~Philippe Petit',
        'You see, one thing is, I can live with doubt and uncertainty and not knowing. I think it\'s much more interesting to live not knowing than to have answers which might be wrong.I have approximate answers and possible beliefs and different degrees of uncertainty about different things, but I am not absolutely sure of anything and there are many things I don\'t know anything about, such as whether it means anything to ask why we\'re here...I don\'t have to know an answer. I don\'t feel frightened not knowing things, by being lost in a mysterious universe without any purpose, which is the way it really is as far as I can tell. It doesn\'t frighten me. ~Richard Feynman'
