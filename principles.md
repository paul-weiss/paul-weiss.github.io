# Principles

### Life
* Focus on things you can control to start your day off

### Work
* If you are using your inbox as a queue, make sure to empty it out on a regular basis.  Daily works best for me.
* Never leave a 5 minute or less task for tomorrow
* If you are not early you are late, make it a point to be early to all meetings
