* A Monkey Is The Next Move
* For Every Monkey There are two parties involved: one to work it and one to supervise it
* Things not worth doing are not worth doing well
* As parents we have taken all the 'next moves' away from our kids.  As a result, all the monkeys are on our backs, and kids don't learn responsibility. In our well-intentioned desire to give them the good things we didn't have, we sometimes neglect to give them the good things we did have
* the more I take care of everything for other people, the more dependent then become
* Experience is not what happens to you; it's what you do with what happens to you
* The more you get rid of your people's monkeys, the more time you have for your people
* bosses who are not impediments to their people can die and not even be missed, and bosses who can die and not be missed are so rare they are virtually irreplaceable
* Oncken's Rules of Monkey Management:
  * Rule 1: The "next moves" are specified
  * Rule 2: The monkey is assigned to a person
  * Rule 3: The risk is covered
  * Rule 4: The time and place for a follow-up is specified
* Why are we doing this? If there is no viable answer, shoot the monkey so that you won't be doing more efficiently things that should not be done in the first place.
* describing the monkey clarifies the 'next move', and the more clearly one understands what must be done, the greater the energy and motivation that exists for doing it.
* Why don't we talk about this again in a couple of days.  In the meantime, you hold on to the problem in case you come up with an idea... and I hope you will!
* The dialogue between boss and staff member must not end until ownership of each monkey is assigned to a person
* people take better care of things they own than things they don't
* I recall the story of the farmer who, when asked by his neighbor why he was working his sons so hard just to grow corn, replied, "I'm not just growning corn.  I'm growing sons!"
* The best way to develop responsibility in people is to giive them responsibility
* the dialoge between boss and staff member shall not end until all monkeys have been insured.
* Monkey Insurance Policies
  * 1. Recommend, then act
  * 2. Act, then advise
* Practice hands-off management as much as possible and hands-on management as much as necessary
* the dialogue between boss and staff member shall not end until the monkey has a checkup appointment
* if I allow the rendering of accountability to be delayed until whenever my people might happen to be ready, the monkey could starve or get sicker in the meantime.
* Doing those things shows what I stand for and by implication, what I won't stand for.  People need to know both.  So, for example, if one of my people is late or absent for an appointment and could have informed me in advance but didn't, I make things a little unpleasant
* Four Rules of Monkey Management
 * Rule 1: Describe the monkey: The dialogue must not end until appropriate "next moves" have been identified and specified.
 * Rule 2: Assign the Monkey: All monkeys shall be owned and handled at the lowest organizational level consistent with their welfare
 * Rule 3: Insure the monkey: Every monkey leaving your presence on the back of one of your people must be covered by one of two insurance policies:
  * 1. Recommend, Then Act
  * 2. Act, Then Advise
 * Rule 4: Check on the Monkey: Proper follow-up means healthier monkeys.  Every monkey should have a checkup appointment.
* Assigning involves a single monkey; Delegation involves a family of monkeys.
* my people are now managing whole families of monkeys (projects) on their own for extended periods of time with minimal involvement from me.
* Managers must not, indeed cannot, delegate until they are reasonably confident that 1) the project is on the right track, and 2) their people can successfully handle the project on their own.
* I cannot delegate until my anxieties allow it
* I can delegate only if I am resonably sure my people know what is to be done
* It would be foolish to delegate to someone without reasonable assurance that he or she can get sufficient resources - time, information, money, people, assistance, and authority - to do the work.
* I cannot turn control of any project over to anyone until I am confident that the cost and timing and quantity and quality of the project will be acceptable
* Three kinds of Organizational Time:
 * Boss-imposed time
 * System-imposed time
 * Self-imposed time
* If you don't like what your boss wants, change what your boss wants, but always do what your boss wants
* If you always agree with your boss, one of you is not necessary
* Loyal opposition: that's when you try to convince your boss to accept some better alternative: but failing that, always wholeheartedly do what he or she wants
* System-imposed time is time we spend on the administrative and related demands from people (peers/associates) other than our bosses and our own staffs, demands that are part of every organization.
* Self-imposed time which is spent doing the things we decide to do, not things done strictly in response to the initiatives of our bosses, peers, and the people who report to us
* It is only with self-imposed time that we make our own unique contribution to an organization
* Subordinate-imposed time is the bad self-imposed time spent working on your staff's monkeys
