                I think it's much more interesting to live not knowing than to have answers which might be wrong. I have
                approximate answers and possible beliefs and different degrees of uncertainty about different things,
                but I am not absolutely sure of anything and there are many things I don't know anything about, such as
                whether it means anything to ask why we're here. I don't have to know an answer. I don't feel frightened
                not knowing things, by being lost in a mysterious universe without any purpose, which is the way it
                really is as far as I can tell.

                The true artistic impulse has nothing to do with pleasing the audience— or, for that matter, with
                pleasing the impresario so you’ll get more jobs or more money. That’s not art. If you are an artist, you
                want to create a giant wall around yourself and, inside that wall, to follow your honesty and your
                intuition. What the audience will see is a man or woman who is prisoner of his or her passion, and that
                is the most inspiring performance in the world.

                Nothing is given to man on earth. Everything he needs has to be produced. And here man faces his basic

                parasite fed by the minds of others. The creator originates. The parasite borrows. The creator faces
                nature alone. The parasite faces nature through an intermediary. “The creator’s concern is the conquest
                of nature. The parasite’s concern is the conquest of men. “The creator lives for his work. He needs no
                other men. His primary goal is within himself. The parasite lives second-hand. He needs others. Others
                become his prime motive. “The basic need of the creator is independence. The reasoning mind cannot work
                under any form of compulsion. It cannot be curbed, sacrificed or subordinated to any consideration
                whatsoever. It demands total independence in function and in motive. To a creator, all relations with
                men are secondary.

                So if you now number yourself among the disenchanted, then you have no choice but to accept things as
                they are, or to seriously seek something else. But beware of looking for goals: look for a way of life.

                Some people will tell you that slow is good – but I’m here to tell you that fast is better. I’ve always
